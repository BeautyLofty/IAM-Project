**Lab 3: Client VM Join to Active Directory Domain**

---

## Objective

Set up a Windows client virtual machine and join it to the existing Active Directory domain. Validate domain authentication, Group Policy application, and user login behavior from a non–Domain Controller system.

This lab simulates a **real corporate workstation** connected to a central AD environment.

---

## Environment

* Hypervisor: VirtualBox
* Domain Controller VM: Windows Server (AD DS)
* Domain: LAB (lab.local)
* Client VM: Windows 10 / Windows 11 (Desktop Experience)
* Domain Users:

  * joejane
  * [second user]
* Security Group:

  * SOCadmin

---

## Lab Overview

In this lab you will:

* Create a new client VM
* Configure networking correctly
* Join the client to the LAB domain
* Log in using a domain user
* Validate AD authentication works outside the Domain Controller

---

## Step 1: Create Client Virtual Machine

1. Open **VirtualBox**
2. Click **New**
3. Configure:

   * Name: LAB-CLIENT01
   * Type: Microsoft Windows
   * Version: Windows 10 / Windows 11 (64-bit)
4. Allocate:

   * Memory: 4 GB (minimum)
   * CPU: 2 cores (if available)
5. Create virtual hard disk (VDI, dynamically allocated)

## Step 2: Configure Networking (Critical)

Client VM must be able to reach the Domain Controller.

1. VM Settings → Network
2. Adapter 1:

   * Attached to: **Internal Network** (or same network as DC)
   * Name: intnet (or same as DC)

## Step 3: Install Windows on Client VM

1. Attach Windows ISO
2. Start VM
3. Complete Windows installation
4. Create **local admin account** temporarily

---

## Step 4: Verify Network Connectivity

On client VM:

1. Open Command Prompt
2. Run:

```
ipconfig
ping <DC-IP>
```

3. Confirm successful replies

## Step 5: Join Client to Domain

1. Open **System Properties**
2. Computer Name tab → Change
3. Select **Domain**
4. Enter:

```
lab.local
```

5. Authenticate using:

```
LAB\\Administrator
```

6. Restart client VM

## Step 6: Domain User Login Test

1. On login screen select **Other User**
2. Log in as:

```
LAB\\joejane
```

3. Verify successful login

## Validation

* Client successfully joined domain
* Domain users authenticate on client
* AD environment functioning as expected

---

## Lessons Learned

* Difference between Domain Controller and client systems
* Importance of DNS and network configuration
* Real-world workstation onboarding process

---

## Skills Demonstrated

* Windows client deployment
* Active Directory domain join
* Network troubleshooting
* Enterprise authentication validation

---

## Next Steps

* Apply Group Policy to client
* Create login restrictions
* Event Viewer authentication logs
* Lab 4: Group Policy Objects (GPO) Hands-on
